# Functional programming - Movie app

I made a movie app connected to an online API.
It includes higher order functions and pure functions - I made a comments on them in the JS files.

For this project I wanted to practice with props and connecting to API.
I had a little help from Sm√°ri but did 97% myself.

It only gives you the most popular movies at the time and a button you can click to get a random movie from the popular movies.
